# VisionVoice: Bridging Media and Language

## Project Description

With the rapid growth of multimedia content in our daily lives, advancements in digital technology are crucial to keep pace. Captioning, a task within natural language processing (NLP), has the potential to transform how we interact with multimedia. Automatic Image and Video Captioning can enable seamless annotation of media, which is instrumental in improving:

Search Algorithms: Enabling content-based search by analyzing media contents directly.
Recommendation Systems: Enhancing personalization through better understanding of user preferences.
The objective of this project is to design and implement models for Image Captioning and Video Captioning, leveraging Deep Learning techniques.
